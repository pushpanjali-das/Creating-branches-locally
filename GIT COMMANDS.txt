									GIT COMMANDS


1.To initialize a local directory as a local repository use the command 		:   navigate to that directory ---> git init
2.After adding file, here files are in the MODIFIED stage ( First stage in git)
3.To move it to staged stage use 			(staged area)			:   git add .  (or)  git add filename.extension
4.To move them to Repository stage (or) to commit i.e., save the changes (Repository)   : git commit -m "message"	
5.Next to push these files to a remote repository ,
 first we need to add that origin link to our local, use				: git remote add origin "repo url"
6.To push use the command								: git push -u origin master
											
												-u :- stands for upstream for future push and pull operations, we again 														need not to use this entire git push -u origin master,
													git push and git pull are enough
												origin :- url of repo is replaced by origin 
												master :- the default branch name, 
Here changes in the master branch of local repo gets pushed to the master branch of the remote repo.
If any other branch is being used, the command will be 					: git push -u origin <branch name>

7.Creating new branch and checkingout on it						: git checkout -b <branch name>
8.Checking the current working branch							: git branch     (or)     git status
9.To track the changes
  understanding current state of repository (staged, untracked etc)			: git status

10.To delete a file when they are staged but not committed				: git reset filename.extension (stops tracking, commit msg not required)  (or) 
											  git rm --cached filename.ext (keeps tracking and commit msg required)

11.To remove the added repository 							: git remote remove <remote name>  (or) git remote remove origin (to remove 																				origin)

git push origin --delete branch_name							: To delete the present in remote repository
